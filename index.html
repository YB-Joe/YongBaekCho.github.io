<b>About</b> <br>

I am a Software Engineer working in Data Team at Linqia with a strong academic background in Computer Science, specifically in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I earned my MS in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>, where I was a member of the <a href="https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/">Active Perception Group</a> advised by <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/3020558">Dr. Yezhou Yang</a> and co-advised by <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2422024">Dr. Yi Ren</a><br>
<br>
Within the realm of Computer Vision, Adversarial Attacks, and Generative Models, my research interests lie. I am particularly dedicated to fortifying synthetic content produced by generative models against adversarial perturbations, aiming to enhance their robustness and security. This entails implementing attributional watermarks into speech generative models like Text-to-Speech synthesis models, voice conversion systems, and other speech synthesis models. By doing so, I strive to strengthen their resilience against various post-processing attacks.<br>
<br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Science from the University of Arizona, further solidifying my technical foundation and passion for the field.
