<b>About</b> <br>

I am a Software Engineer at Linqia with a strong academic background in Computer Science, specifically in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I earned my MS in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>, where I was a member of the <a href="https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/">Active Perception Group</a> advised by <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/3020558">Dr. Yezhou Yang</a> and co-advised by <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2422024">Dr. Yi Ren</a><br>
<br>
My research interests are in the field of Computer Vision, Adversarial Attacks, and Generative Models. I am particularly focused on defending against the misapplication of synthetic content from generative models under adversarial perturbations to improve their robustness and security. This involves embedding attributional watermarks in speech generative models, such as Text-to-Speech synthesis models, voice conversion, and other speech synthesis models, to enhance their resilience against various post-processing attacks.<br>
<br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Science from the University of Arizona, further solidifying my technical foundation and passion for the field.
