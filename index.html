<b>About</b> <br>

I am a Master's Computer Science(Robotics and Artificial Intelligence) student at Arizona State University where I am a member of Active Perception Group advised by Prof. Yezhou Yang and
co-advised by Prof. Yi Ren. <br>

My research interests lie in the area of Computer Vision, Adversarial Attacks and Generative Models. My primary research focus is on how to defend or prevent the misuse of synthetic conetens from
generative models under certain adversarial perturbations and robustness. More specifically, my current research is to embedd attributable(model attribution watermarking of
speech generative models(e.g Text-to-Speech synthesis models, voice conversion and any other speech synthesis models) and improve the robustness and secure under a vareity of post processings(attacks).
