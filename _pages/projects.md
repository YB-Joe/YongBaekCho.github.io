## AI 

### Pacman AI and Logic Wumpus

Project link[[Pacman AI with search altorithms]](https://github.com/YongBaekCho/pacmanAI).
<br>Project link[[Pacman AI(Multi-Agent)]](https://github.com/YongBaekCho/pacmanAIMultiagents).
<br>Project link[[Wumpus World(Logic-Agent]](https://github.com/YongBaekCho/logicagent).
<br>Project link[[Pacman AI(Reinforcement-Learning)]](https://github.com/YongBaekCho/Reinforcement-Learning).

* Implemented search algorithms, multi-agents to solve severalproblems in Pacman domain.
* Used  Reinforcement  learning(Q-learning)  to  train  Pacman  on  large  complexgrids in the presence of adversaries.

## Data Science and Machine Learning/Deep Learning

### University of Arizona Class Scheduling

Project link: [[University management]](https://github.com/YB-Joe/Data_Science).

* Analyzed U of A class scheduling data and RCM data over 10 years.
* Identified problems & suggested solutions in school's management to staff and program director who work at registarar office.

* (The goal of RCM is to provide an incentives-based transparent budget model for the University of Arizona.)

### Decision Tree
Project link: [[Decision Tree(Car Temperature)]].

* Used GraphViz to test and visualize 3 different decision trees and plotted 3 different probability matrixes.
* Collected vehicle temperature data which parked on campus garage and lot.


### U.S. Insurance data(from Kaggle) analysis

Project link: [[US Insurance kaggle data]](https://github.com/YB-Joe/Data_Science).

* Analyzed health state for Insurance subscribers by Age, gender, and Residential Area

### arctic-sea-ice-extent-visualization

Project link: [[Data Visualization for arctic-sea-ice-extent]](https://github.com/YB-Joe/Data_Science).
<br>Project link: [[Data Visualization for arctic-sea-ice-extent-2]](https://github.com/YB-Joe/Data_Science).

* Analyzed the Arctic-sea-ice-extent data and used my own analysis to predict the date the ice will disappear altogether.

### Text Mining

Project link: [[Text-mining]](https://github.com/YB-Joe/Data_Science).
* Computed cosine similarity along with the bag-of-words approach to measure the similarity between paris of documents

### Statistical Machine Learning

Project link: [[SML]](https://github.com/YongBaekCho/StatisticalML).

* Designed Classification(Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) model and implemented K-means Algorithms.(with reports)
