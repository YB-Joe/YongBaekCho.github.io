## Fields of AI

- Machine Learning: adapt to new circumstances and detect and extrapolate patterns
- Natural Language Processing: communicate with humans successfully
- Computer Vision: perceive objects
- Robotics: Manipulate Objects and move them
- Automated Reasoning: use the stored information to answer questions and draw new conclusions
- Knowledge representation: store what it knows or hears
